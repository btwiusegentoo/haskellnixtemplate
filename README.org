* Haskell project template using nix,lorri,niv
** Description
This is a minimal Haskell project template using Nix.
It's minimal and simple. Maybe same as what you will find when you google how to make Haskell project using Nix.
Just made for personal use. I don't think it's perfect but I want a template to make things easier.
** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/btwiusegentoo/haskellnixtemplate <projectname>
cd <projectname>
# delete redundant files
rm -rf .git
# init new project
git init
cabal init
cabal2nix . > default.nix
#+END_SRC
